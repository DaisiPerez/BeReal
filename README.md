## Notes

Building this app was INCREDIBLY challenging. I tried building it on my own at first but there were too many errors. If it wasn't the info.plist, it was the storyboard files. No  matter how many times I would debug it, it would just showcase an empty screen. After my fourth attempt, I decided to use the starter code from Lab 2. The code was a lot cleaner and a lot easier to read. Both apps practically serve the same function, hence why I used the starter code. I changed the title name from "Instaparse" to "BeReal" in storyboard and called it a day. In one of my MANY attempts, I tried to manually change the file name to "BeReal" but that was a really bad idea because it corrupted all my files and I had to start over again. Forgive me for the app not being called "BeReal on the homescreen, I did not want to take any chances. Aside from this project being incredibly frustrating, I did learn a lot!
